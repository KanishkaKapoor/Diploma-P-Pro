			1.Boxing	:value to reference
			2.Unboxing:reference to value
			
	Intervie Question:
	10:What is difference in generic and nongeneric collection
   			Disadvantage
		1.Non generic:Heavy boxing and unboxing required
			For storing: Boxing
			For Retrival:Unboxing
		2.No compile time error Checking(No type safe)	
		
	11.	Question:What is difference between Asp and aspx
		Ans:hello.asp :active server page
			hello.aspx : .web form
			
	12.	Question:I want to print user name when the page is unloaded	
		Answer:That time error,page is not loaded,response.text
				response .write will not be available.. error :page is unloaded
		
	13.how view state works?
		view state is maintain by the server using a hidden form field
		view state increases page size
		always disable the view state (good practice of programming)
		
		ADO.Net:It is a frame work provided by microsoft contains various classes,namespaces using which 
			can connect various databases mysql,sql,almost all database
			contains various namespaces ,those namespaces are called data provider
			it contain different data provinders to connect to different databases
			(known as ADO.NET provider)
			(Activex data object)
			
	Connection Strings
		-Data Sourse(Server Name)
		-Initial Catalog (Database Name)
		-Credentials(user Id,password)sql server Authentication OR
										Integrated Security=true --Windows Authentication
		
		If u want to map client object:using file upload method
		Sever.mappath  :
		
	14.	How do u generate javascript(client side) code in server side code?
	Ans:response.write ""
	
	15.Connection string where we should keep?
	Ans:Connection string keeping at one place ..web config file
	
	Easy maintainace
	Connected Model:
			:-
			
			Client Application<--->	Provider		<--->Database
									1.Connection
									2.Command
									3.Data Reader		
									
	16.When u will use datareader
	Ans:When u want to fetch multiple data at a time a dump in some place.
		Only if connection is open
		Read only 
		Forward only

	Disconnected Model:
			:-
			
			Client Application
					|
				Data Set<--------->Provider
										
								Connection
									|	
									|
								Data Adapter	
								
								
								
	17.Why to use data set:
	Answer:If u cannot return reader object across the methods and accross the application 
	
	
	Disconnected Arch
	
	
	Stored Procedure:U ca write ur Plsql Code
	Advantage :Complie code ..customize

	Database--->SqlDataSource-->grid view
	
	xml file--->xmldatasource-->tree view
	
	The which shows databound control
from where we take dataSource control

data source:        databound control:


Security:
		-Authentication	Who is the user?

		24.Data Source Control caching
		Ans:YOU can chache dataSource
			By default sql data source control uses data table to retrive the data from database
			You can chache these data,it will increase ur performance. these concept is known as 
			Data source control chaching..

		Why MVC?
			For ASP.NET
		1.Simple task:all the life cycle ::Degrade the performance
		2.View State
			U can disable the view state
			Can we enforce the devlepor to force to disable the view state
		(In MVc it works dirctly there is no view state)
		3.No Seperation Of Concern:
			Code is thightly coupled
			u can use any model(control can use any model)
			It is also called fake seperation of Concern
			
			Ans:U  cannot attached any codebehind file.
		4.Low Testability:
			Unique testing is not possible unless the page is loaded
			We cannot force Developer to it
		
		What is MVC ?
		Ans:It is architectural Pattern
			It consist Of 	Model
							View
							Control
			MVC is Open Source
			Based on agile Development
			Always follow Degine Patterns
				S:single responsibility Principle
	If u dont what u show anything to user always use Interface
	
	
	
	MVC Model Diagramatic Model:
				Request
	Client  ----------------------> Controller---->Model-->bussiness Object
			<----------------------			<------		--->Domain Classes
				Response								---->Services	
				
	Client		<-	-	----	-	-	-	-	-	----	--------------->View
	
	Webform--view based architectural
	MVC--Action nased architectural
	
	Controller has all methods as action methods
	
	Url/ControllerName/ActionMethodName ---We can call any method from controller
	
	
	
	Client --------->Route------------> 				-----Controller--Model
														               --View
														 
				Extension										 
	Razor view	: .cshtml
	web form 	:	.aspx
	user control 
	
	
	Why Master page
	:To provide comman web layout
	
	MVC 5:
	Comman layout page(MASTER pAGE)
	
	Ans:Master page equivalent page is layout page
	
	View result is a class which is used to return view
	
	1.When u have view result why u need action result
	Ans:we not only return jason view,status code  example of list of substitution principle
		dirctly implemented by microsoft
		
		I -Iversion control
		
		
		Multiple Controls :Shared Folders
		
		2.can we delete model folder
		Yes we can
		
		3.How u can pass models data to the view ,,how controller passes models data to view?
		Ans:Using View Data Object
			View data is a dictionary _Holds the data in key value pair
			by using view data can pass controller to view
			
			for html+C#
			@{
			Code Block
			}
			
			
		State Management Tech in MVC--Action

			1.View Data		Controller -->view
			2.View Bag
			3.Temp Data		--->for Current Request
			4.Session		--->Browser.
			
			Drawback of viewdata that and viewbag
			1.It is not strongly type
			2.No complile time checking
			3.
			
			Two type of validation
			1.Client side
			2.Server side
			
			What is Catch all route?
